In these two subfolders our optimized versions for both memory layouts can be found.
In the LBDefinitions.h file several flags can be set before compiling. Currently they are
set so that every scenario can be simulated and the corresponding output is put
into the Paraview subfolder. 

In order to achieve the same results we did in the documentation, the flags have to be
set accordingly. The binary in this folder can be used to convert the binary data generated
when using the _MPI_VTK_ flag  to .csv files which can than be read in Paraview.
