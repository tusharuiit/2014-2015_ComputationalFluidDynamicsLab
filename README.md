C Programming Language.

This is a joint project by me, Tao and Manuel in the Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab.
We first solved the Navier Stokes Finite Difference discretization, then we solved the Lattice Boltzmann Fluid Solver.

We chose to parallelize the Lattice Boltzmann Fluid-Solver using MPI Library in C Programming Language. The Lattice Boltzmann
parallelization was completely solved by me. Then, we went on to parallelize it with OpenMP, and used MPI on the LRZ
supercomputer. We also have a PDF report mentioning our work.
